# CS50W Project 2

This is the 'slack' type chat application made using SocketIO. In this a user has to login with a username. He/she will be remembered by this name. After logging in user can join into an already created channel by selecting from channels list or can create a new one. User can now chat with others in that channel.

Personal Touch:

I have added an additional feature in this chat application where by a user can chat privately with another user in the same channel. This chat will not be shown in group chat window.

1. application.py
  This is the main application file.

2. templates folder
  This folder contains 5 html files, they all inherit layout.html file which is also contained in this folder.

3. static folder
  This folder contains channel.js file which is linked to channel.html file contained in templates. A style.css file is also there which is linked to layout.html.
